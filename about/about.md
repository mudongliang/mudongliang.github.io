{:toc}

I am an Associate Professor in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I earned my Ph.D. in [Computer Science from Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), where I collaborated extensively with [Professor Xinyu Xing](http://xinyuxing.org/) at Penn State University. My research focuses on Linux kernel security, with recent work published at top-tier conferences including IEEE S&P (Oakland), USENIX Security, ACM CCS, NDSS, and ASE. Additionally, I am actively exploring emerging areas at LLM for Security, as well as automotive operating system security, with a focus on real-world industrial applications. I am honored to be a recipient of the **ACM CCS 2018 Outstanding Paper Award** and the 2023 Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award for contributions to the Linux kernel and Syzkaller. Additionally, I was recognized in the 2022 and 2024 Wuhan Talent Programs for my research achievements.

[**Prospective Students**] I am looking for multiple Ph.D. students and undergraduate/graduate research interns who share my academic interests and have a solid background in System/Software Security. If you are interested, please send me [emails](mailto:dzm91@hust.edu.cn) about your information.

### Research interest

My research centers on **Software and System Security**, with a focus on developing automated frameworks for vulnerability discovery and lifecycle management. I specialize in advancing fuzzing techniques to uncover zero-day vulnerabilities in complex systems, while also designing methodologies for Vulnerability Reproduction, Crash Deduplication, Vulnerability Root Cause Analysis, Vulnerability Assessment, Vulnerability Patching and etc. I am interested in the OS kernel security, the security of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and LLMs for Security.
